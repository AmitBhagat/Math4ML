      <h1>Deep Learning Architectures</h1>
      <p>A "Body" for every "Brain." <strong>Deep Learning</strong> isn't just one giant network; it's a toolbox of <strong>Architectures</strong> designed for different data types. Just as a <strong>Fish</strong> needs fins and a <strong>Bird</strong> needs wings, an <strong>Image Model</strong> needs layers that "See," and a <strong>Speech Model</strong> needs layers that "Listen."</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="theory">Theoretical Core: Design Principles</h2>
    <p>Architectural design is about <strong>Efficiency</strong>. In a fully-connected MLP, every neuron listens to everyone else. This is <strong>Too Much Information</strong> for an image with 1,000,000 pixels. We design architectures to <strong>Focus</strong> the network's attention on what matters.</p>

        Think of it as <strong>"Optimizing the Wiring."</strong> 
        If you want to understand a <strong>Sentence</strong>, you need wires that carry meaning through <strong>Time</strong>. (RNN). 
        If you want to recognize a <strong>Face</strong>, you need wires that look at <strong>Space</strong>. (CNN). 
        The architecture is the <strong>Hardcoded Strategy</strong> for solving a specific domain.

    <h2 id="inductive-bias">Inductive Bias: The Secret Assumption</h2>
    <p>Every architecture has an <strong>Inductive Bias</strong>—a set of assumptions the model makes about the data <strong>before</strong> it sees it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CNN Bias:</strong> "Nearby pixels are related." (Spatial Invariance).</li>
      <li><strong>RNN Bias:</strong> "The current word depends on the previous one." (Temporal Continuity).</li>
      <li><strong>Transformer Bias:</strong> "Every part of the sequence might be related to any other part." (Global Attention).</li>
    </ul>
